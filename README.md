# Alex Warr's Airport Challenge
This is my solution to the Digital Futures Airport Challenge

## Usage
Clone this repo to your local machine and run `npm install`. `npm audit fix` may also help with any issues that arise.
To run the tests you can use `npm test` or you can run the `test/specRunner.js` directly with `node`.


how to install your project, how to run the tests, how you approached the problem and provide screenshots of interacting with your program.
