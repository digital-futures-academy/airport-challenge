USER STORY 5 
I struggled creating a user story for 5 as I didn't know which way to tackle writing the domain model. I know the output would have to say that the plane has landed.

6. Wrote a test that didn't pass 
7. I had some issues because I for got to define plane as seen in images folder as I had put it as an array. 
8. I also had some issues commiting the work meant I have to make a seperate file and fork the repository again so it also didn't detect files on machine
9. Kept checking the es lint
