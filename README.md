Tests can be run by navigating to the appropriate directory and running 'node specRunner.js' in Terminal

The weather defaults to "sunny" for the purpose of the tests, apart from the test case where it has been set to "stormy" to test whether the plane can be landed in these conditions. However, the weather can be randomised by passing (1, 2) as arguments.
