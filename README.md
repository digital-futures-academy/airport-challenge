Welcome to the **Airport Traffic Controller** App! üòä

## **Introduction**
This wonderful application is designed to efficiently manage and control the flow of flights at airports or fighter aircraft at air bases. Its primary purpose is to ensure smooth and organized operations by providing comprehensive control over the movement and coordination of planes within the designated airspace and under uncertain weather conditions.

### How the App is Created

The development of the Air Traffic Controller application follows a structured approach that incorporates domain modeling and test-driven development (TDD) principles.
* Incorporating specific requirements and user stories into the domain models (see **Table 1**). Through domain modeling, the key objects, relationships, and behaviors of the air traffic control system are defined and implemented. The domain models serve as a blueprint for developing the various components of the application.
* A custom test framework was created to employ the test-driven development. Tests are written before the corresponding code implementation, ensuring that each component of the application is thoroughly tested and meets the expected output.
* All passing tests and associated changes or additions were committed to the codebase to provide evidence-based record of the application's progression.

Note: The decision was made to forgo the implementation of the Plane class in order to maintain simplicity.

# User story 1
As an air traffic controller
So I can get passengers to a destination
I want to instruct the airport to land a plane

# User story 2
As the system designer
So that the software can be used for many different airports
I would like a default airport capacity that can be overridden as appropriate

# User story 3
As an air traffic controller
To ensure safety
I want to prevent landing when the airport is full

So I can get passengers on the way to their destination
I want to instruct the airport to let a plane take off and confirm that it is no longer in the airport

# User story 5
As an air traffic controller
To avoid confusion
I want to prevent asking the airport to let planes take-off which are not at the airport, or land a plane that's already landed

# User story 6

## **Getting Started**

### To install and run Airport Traffic Controller App locally, follow these steps:

1. Fork and clone this repository to your local machine:
      ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/coder3114/airport-challenge
2. Navigate to the project directory:
      ```bash
      cd my-airTrafficController-app
3. Install the dependencies using npm:
      ```bash
      npm install
## **Usage**
---------

1. Start the application by running the following command. This command will start the execution of the application using the airTrafficController.js file as the entry point.
      ```bash
      node airTrafficController.js
2. Interact with the application by customizing the following airport and flights features:

* **Airport Status**: The airport status section displays real-time information about the airport, including its name, capacity, weather, and flights currently at the airport.  

  ![Alt text](airport-status.png)
      

* **Flight Management**: Use the flight management section to view and manage flights. You can add new flights, update flight details, and remove flights from the system.

     ![Alt text](flight-management.png)

3. Interact with the **Flight Control** section by performing requirements such as adding or updating flights, monitoring airport status, issuing instructions, and communicating with relevant personnel.

      ![Real time flow](flight-flow.png)

      This APP adhere the following **Airport operation rules**:
```
      1. No plane can land if the airport is at full capacity to ensure available space before allowing any incoming planes to land.
      2. A plane should be at the airport before being granted permission for take-off.
      3. A plane that is already at the airport cannot land again to prevent duplicate landing requests.
      4. No plane can land or take off during stormy weather conditions (10% possibility by default).
      5. Once a plane successfully takes off, it is considered to have left the airport.
      6. Once a plane lands, it must remain at the airport until its next scheduled take-off.
```

4. Utilize the **Reports and Analytics** section to generate reports on flight statistics and analyze airport performance. This helps to provide data-driven decisions and improve airport operations.
