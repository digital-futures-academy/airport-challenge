Overview of project
--------
To complete this challenge, I firstly designed a domain model for each of the user stories. This allowed me to plan out the objects and properties needed to satisfy the user requirements. Next I used a test driven development approach to incrementally add features to meet each user story. This involved creating failing tests for each user story before writing production code to pass those tests.

The domain models created can be found [here](domainModels.md).
