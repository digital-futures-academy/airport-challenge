## Instructions

For the specifications and how to clone and install it on your local machine please go to [Instructions](https://github.com/namcap1/airport-challenge/blob/main/instructions.md). Scroll down to the steps and follow those instructions. 

For the Criteria also go to that link and scroll down to the criteria.

## Information

There is a custom made test-framework in [Test-Framework](https://github.com/namcap1/airport-challenge/blob/main/test_framwork.js) please feel free to change it.

There are four different spec files that rigirously test the criteria [Airport.spec](https://github.com/namcap1/airport-challenge/blob/main/spec/airport.spec.js), [Plane.spec](https://github.com/namcap1/airport-challenge/blob/main/spec/plane.spec.js), [Weather.spec](https://github.com/namcap1/airport-challenge/blob/main/spec/weather.spec.js) and [Combined.spec](https://github.com/namcap1/airport-challenge/blob/main/spec/combined.spec.js). 

The criteria has been seperated into 3 different classes across 3 different files [Airport](https://github.com/namcap1/airport-challenge/blob/main/src/airport.js), [Plane](https://github.com/namcap1/airport-challenge/blob/main/src/plane.js) and 
[Weather](https://github.com/namcap1/airport-challenge/blob/main/src/weather.js). These pass all the current tests in the spec but please have a go at creating your own within the source file. Feel free to change the spec tests or the source code as your see fit

## How to Test

It is currently set up in the [SpecRunner](https://github.com/namcap1/airport-challenge/blob/main/specRunner.js) to be able to run the named spec files using npm test. But you can also use node spec/filename to run individual spec files.
