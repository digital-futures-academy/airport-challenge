Airport Challenge
=================
About the project 
-----------------
At Digital Futures I am learning the processes and best practices when writing code. This project is Airport challenge that i did in one week. The purpose/ aim of the project is to:

* learn buiding functionality for applications based on user requirement.
* Putting to practice testing framework making sure that my code functions correctly.
* To use classes and objects in my code for reproducibility and efficiency.
* To practice using Git and GitHub to commit my work and open a Pull Request.

This is my first time using javascript where i have created my own testing framework.

Built With 
-----------------
* npm
* Git & Github

Project Review and Roadmap
--------------------------
* I learnt the importance of test driven development and creating failing test.

I a problem using pop() to remove a plane from planeAtAirport array, I ended up using splice() which allowed me to remove a specific plane from the array. This helps when i have multiple planes in the array.

What i could to diffrently is having a go at the Extended Acceptance Criteria, and also lint my code.

* This challenge can can be improved by making the code loosely coupled
test using jasmine framework, to unite test

Where could this project go ?
-------------------------------
The project can benefit from Having Terminal as planes go to different destinations and have set time for takeOff and landPlane.

Instructions
---------

* Feel free to use google, your notes, books, etc. but work on your own.
* Keep it SIMPLE - it's not nearly as complicated as it first may look.
* You must [submit your challenge](https://airtable.com/shrUGm2T8TYCFAmjN) by the deadline, wherever you get to.
* Use your own test framework and evidence your test-driven development by committing on passing tests.
* Please write your own README detailing how to install your project, how to run the tests, how you approached the problem and provide screenshots of interacting with your program.
* If you refer to the solution of another coach or student, please put a link to that in your README.
* Please create separate files for every class, module, and spec.

Steps
-------

1. Fork this repo, and clone to your local machine
2. `npm install` to install project dependencies
3. Convert stories into a representative domain model and test-drive your work.
4. Run your tests using `npm test` or `node specRunner.js`
5. OPTIONAL: [Lint](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/getting-started) your source code using `npx eslint src`.

Task
-----

We have a request from a client to write the software to control the flow of planes at an airport. The planes can land and take off provided that the weather is sunny. Occasionally it may be stormy, in which case no planes can land or take off.  Here are the user stories that we worked out in collaboration with the client:

#### Acceptance Criteria
```
As an air traffic controller
So I can get passengers to a destination
I want to instruct the airport to land a plane

As the system designer
So that the software can be used for many different airports
I would like a default airport capacity that can be overridden as appropriate

As an air traffic controller
To ensure safety
I want to prevent landing when the airport is full

As an air traffic controller
So I can get passengers on the way to their destination
I want to instruct the airport to let a plane take off and confirm that it is no longer in the airport

As an air traffic controller
To avoid confusion
I want to prevent asking the airport to let planes take-off which are not at the airport, or land a plane that's already landed
```

#### Extended Acceptance Criteria
```
As an air traffic controller
To ensure safety
I want to prevent takeoff when weather is stormy

As an air traffic controller
To ensure safety
I want to prevent landing when weather is stormy

As an air traffic controller
To count planes easily
Planes that have landed must be at an airport
```

Your task is to test drive the creation of a set of classes/objects to satisfy all the above user stories. You will need to use a random number generator to set the weather (it is normally sunny but on rare occasions it may be stormy). In your tests, you'll need to stub random behaviour to ensure consistent test behaviour.

Your code should defend against [edge cases](http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/125587/what-are-the-difference-between-an-edge-case-a-corner-case-a-base-case-and-a-b) such as inconsistent states of the system ensuring that planes can only take off from airports they are in; planes that are already flying cannot take off and/or be in an airport; planes that are landed cannot land again and must be in an airport, etc.
