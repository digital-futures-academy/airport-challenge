# Airport Challenge attempt

## Installation
```
Fork this repository, clone into a folder on your local machine. In terminal run "npm -i"
```
## Running tests
```
Run the test using "npm test" or "node specRunner.js" in the terminal.
```
## How I approached the problem
```
The first step was to break down the user stories into domain models.
The spec runner and test-framework was written first.
Next was to write the first test and make it fail.
After this, was to write the first production code to pass the failing test.
Previous two steps were repeated throughout, following the domain model loosely.
