We have a request from a client to write the software to control the flow of planes at an airport. We have the following user stories:




(1) "As an air traffic controller,

So I can get passengers to a destination,

I want to instruct the airport to land a plane."

(2) "As the system designer,

So that the software can be used for many different airports,

I would like a default airport capacity that can be overridden as appropriate."

(3) "As an air traffic controller,

To ensure safety,

I want to prevent landing when the airport is full."

(4) "As an air traffic controller,

So I can get passengers on the way to their destination,

I want to instruct the airport to let a plane take off and confirm that it is no longer in the airport."

(5) "As an air traffic controller,

To avoid confusion,

I want to prevent asking the airport to let planes take-off which are not at the airport, or land a plane that's already landed."
