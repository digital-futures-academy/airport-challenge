## Lewis Bensted Airport Challenge
####Introduction
This programme is designed to control the flow of aeroplanes at a an airport. Classes have been
written for both the planes and the airport which contain methods for determining whether the plane can land or not.


#### Usage
To run tests on this programme, after cloning the repository, input the command 'npm test' in the terminal whilst
in the main directory. If further tests are required to be performed, this can be done in the 'airport.spec' file
by creating or updating instances of the 'Plane' and 'Airport' class and passing them through the 'test.it()' function, as done in the current tests.

#### Code
The code in the 'test' file is the same used in the model solutions for the 'Bob's Bagels' challenge, found at
https://github.com/digital-futures-academy/bobs-bagels-demo/blob/main/test-framework.js. All other work is my own.
