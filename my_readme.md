## Colin - Airport Challenge 

This is my implementation of the airport challenge as part of my training in the Modern Software Engineering cohort at the Digital Futures Academy. 

The objectives of this challenge are to:
- Write a domain model from given user stories 
- Develop a simple, consistent testing framework 
- Understand and implement some stages of the software development lifecycle (Domain Modelling, Writing test framework, Source Code, Refactoring) 

All resources can be found on the following github repository [Airport Challenge][https://github.com/FractalFraction/airport-challenge]
