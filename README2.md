#How I approached the problem?
I began by creating user stories for each of the cases and then used domain modelling to plan out my test driven development throughout the project, there was a bit of a problem after doing some of the extended criteria as this would affect some of the other tests and cause them to fail as the stormy weather would not allow some planes to land or takeoff however I felt this project allowed me to have a good insight into my own current capabilities with test driven development.
