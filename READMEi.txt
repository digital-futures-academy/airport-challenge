Object     Properties    Messages   Output
Airport    planes[]      airport()  airport()@string
           capacity()    capacity() airport.capacity()@integer
Plane      name()                   plane@string         

Installation
$ git clone git@github.com:lottiejj/airport-challenge.git

npm install
 

To run tests
node specRunner.js
or
npm test

Things I have achieved
I have created a domain model to display the objects, properties, messages and outputs. 
Used the setup, execute and verify steps in order to create a test framework (airport.spec.js)
Created source code to allow the tests to run succesfully
Commited and pushed my work via git

 

Difficulties
I had a go at the extension but struggled. I'll add them in over the week when I've had more time to research.
