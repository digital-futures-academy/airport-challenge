# Airport Challenge

// Please write your own README detailing how to install your project, **how to run the tests**, how you approached the problem and provide screenshots of interacting with your program.

## How to Install and Run the Project

The programme has three classes which you need to create instances of: 

- what classes there are - what the input needs to be for each 

- Can view the total number of planes and airports in existent (that have been created)
- explain how the stormy weather application works 

> Run **node airportRunWay.js** in the terminal to run the project.

## How to Run the Tests

There are 20 tests altogether. 

> Run **node testRunner.js** in the terminal to run the tests.
