As an air traffic controller
So I can get passengers to a destination
I want to instruct the airport to land a plane
//Objects: airport, plane
//Airport Properties:
airportID, landedPlanes
//Airport Methods() = outputs:

//Plane Properties:
planeID,

//Plane Methods() = outputs:
land(Airport) = +1 plane to airport.landedPlanes array



As the system designer
So that the software can be used for many different airports
I would like a default airport capacity that can be overridden as appropriate
//Objects: airport, plane
//Airpot Properties:
airportID, landedPlanes, maxPlaneCapacity*
//Airport Methods() = outputs:

//Plane Properties:
planeID,

//Plane Methods() = outputs:
land(Airport) = +1 plane to airport.landedPlanes array


As an air traffic controller
To ensure safety
I want to prevent landing when the airport is full
//Objects: airport, plane
//Airpot Properties:
airportID, landedPlanes, maxPlaneCapacity
//Airport Methods() = outputs:

//Plane Properties:
planeID,

//Plane Methods() = outputs:
land(Airport) = +1 plane to airport.landedPlanes array, unless full*

As an air traffic controller
So I can get passengers on the way to their destination
I want to instruct the airport to let a plane take off and confirm that it is no longer in the airport
//Objects: airport, plane
//Airpot Properties:
airportID, landedPlanes, maxPlaneCapacity
//Airport Methods() = outputs:
land(Plane) = +1 plane to airport.landedPlanes array, unless full
takeoff(Plane) = -1 plane to airport.landedPlanes array

//Plane Properties:
planeID,

//Plane Methods() = outputs:

As an air traffic controller
To avoid confusion
I want to prevent asking the airport to let planes take-off which are not at the airport, or land a plane that's already landed

As an air traffic controller
To count planes easily
Planes that have landed must be at an airport
