# **My approach**

1. Firstly using the User Stories, I came up with basic Domain models for each test.
2. For each failure when running tests, I provided screenshots (which can be found in the images folder) for each test
3. Once a test was running correctly, I moved onto the next User Story.
4. I had trouble with Test 5, I knew I needed an if statement to compare what was inside my array at the time or if not in the array, but could not get it to work. (screenshots provided).
